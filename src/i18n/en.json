        { "question": "What about the SEF portal?", "answer": "The bot generates an XML file in UBL 2.1 format. You just upload it to efaktura.gov.rs — no manual entry required." },
        { "question": "I don't have a dispatcher — do I get all features?", "answer": "Yes, you have access to all modules — trips, CMR, invoices, e-invoices, statistics. No dispatcher needed." },
        { "question": "How long does onboarding take?", "answer": "The entire process takes 1 day. Sign up, enter your company details — and start working. All instructions are on our website." },
        { "question": "Do drivers need smartphones?", "answer": "Yes, any Android or iPhone with Telegram. Most drivers already have a phone." },
        { "question": "Does Lako work with ERP systems?", "answer": "Lako works as a standalone system and does not require ERP integration (PANTHEON, SAP, etc.). Documents are generated independently." },

        { "question": "How is my data technically protected?", "answer": "All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (PostgreSQL with encryption). Automatic backups are made every 24 hours and stored for 30 days. Server access is restricted to authorized personnel only." },
